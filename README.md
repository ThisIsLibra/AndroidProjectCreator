#  AndroidProjectCreator
Convert an APK to an Android Studio Project using multiple Open Source tools. Tools that are unavailable are mirrored using repositories on my own Github account (copyright remains with the original creators, those repositories only serve as a mirror).

For more information, refer to [this](https://maxkersten.nl/projects/androidprojectcreator/) page on my website. If you've got any questions, please contact me on Twitter [@LibraAnalysis](https://twitter.com/LibraAnalysis)!
