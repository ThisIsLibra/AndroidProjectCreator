# AndroidProjectCreator
Convert an APK to an Android Studio Project using multiple open-source tools. Tools that are unavailable are mirrored using repositories on my own Github account (copyright remains with the original creators, those repositories only serve as a mirror).

For more information, refer to [this](https://maxkersten.nl/projects/androidprojectcreator/) page on my website. If you've got any questions, please contact me on Twitter [@Libranalysis](https://twitter.com/Libranalysis)!
